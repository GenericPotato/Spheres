    "Hey friends! This is a quick introduction to circle packing. The problem of circle packing in words is to find the largest radius r such that N circles if radius b fill a square (or any other surface) without any overlap. Mathematically, the parameters we can vary are b and N. Here we aim to find r for some fixed N i.e. b=b(N). TO formulate this problem, we assume we have a list of N positions given by $\\{r_{i}\\}$ such that $|r_i-r_j|\\geq 2b$. Once we know b, the calculation of packing density is a trivial exercise."

    "There have been many proposed algorithms for many situations. For instance if our surface was the surface of a sphere instead of a square, the problem can be reduced to an electrostatic problem. The argument goes as follows. Suppose we could arrange N points on the surface of a sphere such that the distance between any two of them is as large as possible. Then we could expand a circle over each point until the circles touched and our packing problem would be solved. This can be done by releasing N electrons on the surface of a conducting sphere. As electrons repel and seek to maximise distance between each other, they would solve our problem for us. This method involves coding an electrostatic potential for N electrons and letting the simulation run till the electrons stop and expanding circles around each electron until the circles hit each other. This method is called the Thomson Problem which you could Google."

    "Another set of methods use random 'shaking'. This is what we would do irl. Simply hold your square and 'shake'. The shaking can be achieved by rearranging the circles slightly by some specified algorithm. A variation of these methods is called the 'grow and slide' method. In this we set N points randomly on the surface and expand circles around each point. whenever the circles touch, we slide the circles past(shift the centres) such that they keep in touch but do not intersect. The KEY difference between these methods and the potential method is that the former finds GLOBAL solutions i.e. the best whereas the latter find LOCAL solutions which means we are not guaranteed that this is the best we can do. For the latter, we would have to run many runs to check if we have gotten the true packing maximum. "

    "We should also consider our surfaces. The easiest surface is a square but its also the most researched one. We could do n-gons and the circle as well. Or we could transcend Euclidean geometry and choose the surface to be a sphere, or a torus of some genus, a Klein bottle, etc. These will complicate the code but probably have interesting results."

    "- On computational side, most used algo is the electrons on a sphere problem also known as Thomson problem or its generalisation the Tammes problem. This algo finds the global optimum i.e. the best solution. For large N, search space becomes exponentially large making computation intractable so good only for small N.\n",

    "On a sphere, the line element is given by: $\\vec{dr}=dr\\hat{r}+rd\\theta\\hat{\\theta}+r\\sin{\\theta}d\\phi\\hat{\\phi}$.
