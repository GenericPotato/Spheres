Sci Comm Cum Throne

Hello frens, welcome to our corner in the GitHub Universe. This repository has been set up to store codes/jupyter notebooks for our Sci Comm project. It is a public repository which means anyone can see stuff, etc. I am hoping no one forks with us. I will have a hard backup on my comm and on the cloud just in case.

## Prereqs:
1. Install Visual Build Tools 14.0 or above using this link: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
2. Assuming you have Spyder 3.0 and above go to Anaconda Prompt and type :
```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
