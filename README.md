# Spheres
Sci Comm Cum Throne

Hello frens, welcome to our corner in the GitHub Universe. This repository has been set up to store codes/jupyter notebooks for our Sci Comm project. It is a public repository which means anyone can see stuff, etc. I am hoping no one forks with us. I will have a hard backup on my comm and on the cloud just in case.

## Prereqs:
1. Install Visual Build Tools 14.0 or above using this link: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
2. Assuming you have Spyder 3.0 and above go to Anaconda Prompt and type : (note you can add code blocks in github.)
```
pip install spherical-geometry
```
3. The complete documentation for this python library can be found at these links:
- https://spacetelescope.github.io/spherical_geometry/spherical_geometry/index.html
- https://github.com/spacetelescope/spherical_geometry
4. Jupyter main file is shared here. You can upload any file here relevant to project but please for the love of Satan make the subject matter clear. Good format is filename_person_topic.extension.

Cheers!
